  # Use this override only on Linux hosts when you want the containers to share the host network.
  # This makes the services reachable on your host's LAN IP without port mappings (useful for physical devices).

  db:
    network_mode: host

# Usage:
# docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.host.yml up --build
